    "### Nightlights\n",
    "Nightlights are highly correlated with poverty (Neal, J.) and from our experience, to some extent with food security. For each AOI and relevant period, we derive the luminosity from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the US Department of Commerce. In particular we use the NOAA Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) monthly product, normalized by the DMSP-OLS Nighttime Lights Time Series, also from NOAA. The result is a georeferenced dataset with the luminosity shown on a 100 metre x 100 metre grid. Each surveyed cluster is then assigned an average luminosity from the area around its location. The core of the code that handles this data source is the nightlights class."
